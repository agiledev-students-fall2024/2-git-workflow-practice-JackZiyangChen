# Git Practice

### Why I find this article interesting
I find this article interesting because we briefly touched up on the microservices architecture during the lecture, and I find this to be a very interesting application of microservices. The use of microservices at SoundCloud at a large scale demonstrated the pros and cons of using microservices, and how it can (potentially) be beneficial for a large scale application.

The article discussed how SoundCloud uses "BFF" (Backend for Frontend) to handle the different clients that SoundCloud has. This is interesting because it shows how SoundCloud uses microservices to handle the different clients that they have, and how they can scale their application to handle the different clients that they have.

The article also highlights both the benefits and drawbacks SoundCloud experienced when adopting microservices. One of the key benefits is scalability; by breaking down services into smaller, independently deployable components, SoundCloud could scale different parts of their system based on specific demand. This modularity also made it easier for teams to develop, deploy, and maintain services without impacting others, increasing overall agility, which speaks to the benefits of microservices in general.

However, the drawbacks of microservices became apparent as well. One major challenge SoundCloud faced is the complexity in managing their distributed systems. As the number of services grew, so did the difficulty in monitoring, debugging, and ensuring reliability across the system.

### Brian Zou - commentary on the article
The article is interesting to me because of the instructional nature of it. It is a very straightforward
tutorial on how to use Git within the context of BitBucket. In my internship over the summer,
my company used the Atlassian suite (which includes BitBucket), so the article is relevant to my work experience.
Furthermore, the article provided very helpful graphics that help explain things such as how various
files and stored and moved around (e.g. working directory -> staging area). Additionally, the article
provides screenshots with labels that help explain exactly how to perform certain crucial administrative functions
in BitBucket. 
I think something that the article executes very well is a good flow of information. I was never overwhelmed when
reading the article because of the very hands-on nature of the tutorial. The article provided necessary code examples,
as well as graphics that help to reinforce the git functions and workflow. Additionally, the steps are clearly labeled
in order of how they should be executed, with appropriate explanations listed below them.
I think that this article has given me some ideas on how I can better organize my future documentation, as the flow of the article
showcases how good documentation can make certain software and tools easier to operate.
